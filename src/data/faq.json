        "question": "Can I see a preview of the Churchlogo before I purchase it?",
        "answer": "Unfortunately, no. If we were to offer samples of each signature, the quality of designs would decrease, because our logos are handcrafted with creativity, skill, and passion by our lovely designers to ensure maximum quality and elegance. However, all Churchlogo orders are risk-free, thanks to unlimited revisions offered on every order. This allows you to make design and style changes to your signature."
