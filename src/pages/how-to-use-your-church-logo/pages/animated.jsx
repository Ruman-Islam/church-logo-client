                    professional touch to your branding. Here’s a step-by-step
                    guide to help you get started:

                        <Typography>
                          Ensure you have your Church Logo in a format suitable
                          for animation, such as an Illustrator file (.ai) or a
                          high-resolution PNG.

                        <Typography>
                          Open Adobe After Effects and create a new composition.
                          Import your logo file by dragging it into the project
                          panel or using <strong>File &gt; Import</strong>.

                        <Typography>
                          Break down your logo into different layers if it’s not
                          already layered. This will allow you to animate each
                          part of the logo independently.

                              Use keyframes to animate the position and scale of
                              your logo elements. For example, you can make
                              parts of your logo move in from different
                              directions or scale up from zero.

                              dynamic effects. For instance, you can make your
                              logo spin or fade in.
